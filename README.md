Coloring greyscale images with deep learning.

For more details on this, Kindly check the paper - <br><br>

I tried to implement the same architecture as present in the paper, however, due to GPU and RAM limitation, I was unable to complete it.<br>I removed the fusion of inception network and trained on nearly 5000 images. Which gave average results but not satisfactory.<br>
<br>
<b>Key takeaways</b> -Â <br>
<ul>The network is very bad in generalizing at a lower number of epochs with a varied dataset, maybe I have to try with a larger dataset and more number of epochs.</ul><br><ul>I suggest going with a domain-specific dataset, for example, coloring images of nature, train the model with a similar dataset.</ul>
